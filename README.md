# Bosons in Optical Lattices
In this project a unidimensional system formed by ultracold bosonic
atoms trapped in the potentials wells of an homogeneous and inhomogeneous
optical lattice has been studied. It is supposed that atoms
are in their fundamental state, and their internal degree of freedom is
not affected. The system is described using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian,

$$ H = -\sum_{i=1}^N\left(\hat a_i^\dagger \hat a_{i+1} + \hat a_i \hat a^\dagger_{i+1}\right) + \frac{U}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N_L} \hat n_i (\hat n_i -1) + W\sum_{i=1}^{N_L} h_i \hat n_i $$

which includes the kinetic energy through the tunneling of the
bosons between two neighbouring wells; the potential energy which is
different from zero if in the same well where there are at least two bosons,
and a local and random potential energy which describes the inhomogeneities
of the trapping potential due to possible experimental errors. A more detailed explanation can be found at Eq. 2.1 of (insert document)



In this work, we have supposed that the number of minimums
in the optical lattice is equal to the number of bosons. The statistical
characteristics of this system have been investigated solving the time
independent Schr¨odinger equation. To this effect, the eigenvectors have
been analysed by means of the energies, expected value of the number
of bosons in each well and the two body correlation factor while
varying the parameters which characterize the system for the homogeneous
and inhomogeneous optical lattice. Furthermore, the dynamic of
the systems has been analysed solving the time dependent Schr¨odinger
equation. Two different regimes have been studied, firstly a sudden
switch on of the tunneling, and secondly with a gradual switch on of
the parameter which controls the tunneling to ilustrate the adiabaticity
of the system.
